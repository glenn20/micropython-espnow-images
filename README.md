# Precompiled Micropython ESPNow Images for the ESP32 and ESP8266

A collection of pre-compiled micropython images (including espnow support) for
the esp32 and esp8266.

These are provided as a convenience for users until the ESPNow code is
accepted into a Micropython release.

These images are compiled from the **espnow-g20*** branches at
<https://github.com/glenn20/micropython>.

The Pull Request for ESPNow support is available at:
<https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/6515>.

Documentation for the ESPNow module can be browsed at:
<https://micropython-glenn20.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/espnow.html>.

General micropython documentation at:
<https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/index.html>.

Each folder contains the following firmware images:

- `firmware-esp32-GENERIC.bin`: For the ESP32 GENERIC build target.
- `firmware-esp8266-GENERIC_1M.bin`: For the ESP8266 GENERIC_1M build target
  (1MB RAM devices)
- `firmware-esp8266-GENERIC.bin`: For the ESP8266 GENERIC build target (2+MB
  RAM devices)

These images are built following the instructions at
<https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/ports/esp32/README.md>
and
<https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/ports/esp8266/README.md>.

Images can be written to the ESP32 and ESP8266 devices over usb using
esptool.py (install using pip), eg, one of:

```bash
esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200 write_flash --flash_size=4MB --flash_mode=qio 0 firmware-esp8266-GENERIC_1M.bin

esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 firmware-esp32-GENERIC.bin

esptool.py --chip esp32s2 --port /dev/ttyACM0 write_flash -z 0x1000 firmware-esp32-GENERIC_S2.bin
```

### Micropython v1.20.0 (latest)

- [20230427_espnow-g20-v1.20.0-2-gcc4c716f6](20230427-v1.20.0-espnow-2-gcc4c716f6):
  - Branch
    **[espnow-g20-v1.20.0](https://github.com/glenn20/micropython/tree/espnow-g20-v1.20.0)**
    patches applied against Micropython release **v1.20.0** on 27 April 2023.
    - API changes following PR review:
      (see `espnow` [module docs](https://micropython-glenn20.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/espnow.html)):
      - Rename `timeout` config option to `timeout_ms`:
        - `config(timeout=xx)` -> `config(timeout_ms=xx)`
      - If `timeout_ms < 0`: disable timeout on wait for messages.
      - Rename `ESPNow.on_recv()` to `ESPNow.irq()`:
        - Remove optional second argument to `ESPNow.irq()`:
          - `irq(callback[, arg])` -> `irq(callback)`
      - Rename `espnow.ETH_ALEN` to `espnow.ADDR_LEN`.
    - I have been able to test images for the following boards:
      - esp32: `GENERIC UM_TINYS2 UM_TINYS3 UM_FEATHERS2 UM_FEATHERS3 GENERIC_S2
        GENERIC_S3`
      - esp8266: `GENERIC GENERIC_1M`

### Micropython v1.19.1

- [20220709_espnow-g20-v1.19.1-espnow-6-g44f65965b](20220709_espnow-g20-v1.19.1-espnow-6-g44f65965b):
  - Branch
    **[v1.19.1-espnow-6-g44f65965b](https://github.com/glenn20/micropython/tree/v1.19.1-espnow-6-g44f65965b)**
    patches applied against Micropython release **v1.19.1**.
    - Fixup for callback methods: **ESPNow.irq()** and **ESPNow.on_recv()**:
      - See docs at:
        <https://micropython-glenn20.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/espnow.html#callback-methods>.
      - New tests in tools/multi_espnow/15_irq_test.py.

  - Branch
    **[v1.19.1-espnow-4-g537248958](https://github.com/glenn20/micropython/tree/espnow-g20-v1.19.1)**
    patches applied against Micropython release **v1.19.1**.
    - Built on latest espnow-g20 patches rebased against v1.19.1 micropython
      release tag.
    - **API Change**:
      - Use `import espnow` instead of `from esp import espnow`.
        - This is necessitated by the recent simplification of the C module
          supported by a python wrapper module: [espnow.py](https://github.com/glenn20/micropython/blob/espnow-g20/ports/esp32/modules/espnow.py).
      - `.recv()` and `.any()` method supported on esp8266
      - `.any()` method and iterator support on esp8266
      - asyncio support on esp8266 (for GENERIC target - ie. devices with >= 2MB
        flash))
      - Add `.recvinto()` method for esp32 and esp8266
    - Updated docs at <https://micropython-glenn20.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/espnow.html>. -->

### Micropython v1.18

- [20220423_espnow-g20-v1.18-14-g78cdcdfdc](20220423_espnow-g20-v1.18-14-g78cdcdfdc):
  - Branch
    **[espnow-g20-v1.18](https://github.com/glenn20/micropython/tree/espnow-g20-v1.18)**
    patches applied against Micropython release **v1.18** on 23 April 2022.
    - Includes: RSSI monitoring, asyncio support (aioespnow.py)
      - New implementation of RSSI monitoring (no change to user API)
        - RSSI of first message(s) from peer is no longer lost
        - Device table is updated on call to recv()/irecv(), so you must read
          the message out of the buffers before the rssi value is updated in
          e.peers (see docs). This also reduces the workload in the internal
          function (espnow_recv_cb()).
    - ESP32 images are built with v4.2 IDF
      - If `micropython.mem_info()` was only showing ~64k RAM, this should be
        fixed
    - ESP32S2 and ESP32C3 are built with v4.4 IDF.
    - No new ESP8266 images as there are no differences from prior uploads.

        write() methods)
- [20220408_espnow-g20-rssi-v1.18-6-g24cf16719](20220408_espnow-g20-rssi-v1.18-6-g24cf16719):

        other images are untested.

  - Includes espnow-enabled firmware image for the ESP32S2 targets available
    in v1.17 (compiled with ESP IDF v4.3.1):
    - GENERIC_S2 (no SPIRAM support),
      [UM_TINYS2](https://unexpectedmaker.com/tinys2) and
      [UM_FEATHERS2](https://feathers2.io/)
      - The UM_* targets include support for the SPIRAM and some additional
        board support modules from UM:
        ([feathers2.py](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/v1.17/ports/esp32/boards/UM_FEATHERS2/modules/feathers2.py)
        and
        [tinys2.py](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/v1.17/ports/esp32/boards/UM_TINYS2/modules/tinys2.py)).
      - Unfortunately there is no generic S2 image available for v1.17 with
        SPIRAM support.
